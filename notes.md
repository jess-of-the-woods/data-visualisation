Notes:

browserify and render to DOM (debug browserify process.. huge file, lags, browser console errors)

'npm start' to start, logs to console

work on rendering tweets to page

why is there a page at localhost:3000? Server doesnt seem to be running.. Getting error msg when try to run.. 'unhandled error'
